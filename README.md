# World Of Wrestling!!

## Combat:

An integral part of wrestling is being HYPED up.

Being HYPED UP lets you do CRAZY S##T

Regular style combat uses more conventional moves, each of which generates HYPE when successful, and does some health damage. Doing the same kind of regular move yields less HYPE, so players are incentivized to vary their attacks to maximize HYPE.

Doing CRAZY moves sequentially costs HYPE, and each successive move reduces accuracy but can inflict more damage.

Players can cap a CRAZY move sequence with a special SIGNATURE MOVE to attempt to win the match then and there (by dealing a lot of damage to their opponent's health)

A fighter loses the match when their health is reduced to zero

Health is of course a somewhat metaphorical word for a fighter's staying power, since it is also heavily influenced by morale as well as HP (not that we're using HP)

Fighting is stateful: A big factor in what you can do and what can be done to you in a fight is determined by what physical state you're in (on the ground, on top of something, etc.).
Your state is altered by moves that can be done to you and you can spend HYPE to alter your state - there is no single optimal state, but rather, each different one makes different possibilies available. However, certain states are clearly less good i.e. being on the floor.

## Skill Tree:

You progress through the game by doing a series of fights with a series of bosses. When you defeat a boss you add his SIGNATURE MOVE to your repertoire, and also choose one of two unique perks for your character.

You will then be given a hint at what your next opponent will be like, and given the chance to prepare for the next fight.

For moves, you will have a limited amount of ORBS which you can allocate to make different moves available to you to use in fights. The allocation can always be changed between fights.

## Fighter Classes:

Each class of fighter will be oriented around the game's functions/values

- High-Flier

- Tank

- SuperStar AKA Hero With A Thousand Faces

There will also be two 'karmic' alignments, Face vs Heel, and a player's actions will largely determine which they become (moves are all weighted with karma, and you'll be given choices in game but not necessarily in fights to choose a 'virtuous' or 'villainous' course for your character).

Karma system will also have a 'point of no return' threshold, wherein you are committed to a particular alignment, and this will determine how the final boss is portrayed in the leadup to the final encounter. Subtle alterations to the rest of the game's story will also be caused by this.

## Cut-Scenes/Dialogues:

Cutscenes will be composed of a foreground containing a character's face and a dialogue box, superimposed on a background. These would be fed as props to a few components and a set timeout hook would control the duration between prop changes.

## Progression Through the World:

You basically teleport between encounters. You will be given the opportunity to spend / reallocate various points and currencies between combats, and there will be some additional challenges between fights. The main thrust is the fights though.
